# Rosalind : bioinformatic training

Python 3.9.1

This repository contains code that were used to resolve bioinformatic problems from the Rosalind website.
Every file can be use separately and independantly. Most of them are organised in fonctions, in order to be reuse in more complex problems.
They were made to shape data and resolve them for the kind of dataset from each problem.

Codes are not shortest, simpliest or fastest. 
I wanted to use fewer additionnal packages and solving with Python main fonctions, and regular expressions sometimes.

All problems can be found here :
